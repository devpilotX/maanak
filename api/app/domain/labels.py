"""Human labels for the domain enumerations.

Every enum value can be turned into a label mechanically by replacing underscores
with spaces and capitalising the first letter. That is right most of the time and
wrong in the places a reader notices: it produced "Mrp close up" for
``mrp_close_up``, "Fssai licence" for ``fssai_licence`` and "Non compliant" for
``non_compliant``.

So the mechanical rule stays as the default and this module holds the exceptions:
acronyms, hyphenated compounds and the two or three phrases that read better
reordered. Anything absent from :data:`OVERRIDES` keeps the mechanical label, which
means adding an enum member never requires editing this file unless its label is
one of those exceptions.

The labels are served from ``/api/v1/reference/vocabulary`` and are what the browser
renders, so this is the only place a value's wording is decided.
