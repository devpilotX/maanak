"""Worker tasks.

``analyse_evidence`` is the heavy path: download the original, build derivatives,
run OCR, locate declarations, write candidates. It runs here rather than in a
request handler because a full-resolution package photograph takes seconds.

Idempotency: the task deletes any candidates it previously produced for the same
evidence before writing new ones, and derivatives are written with ``overwrite``.
Running the task twice therefore leaves the same state as running it once, which is
what makes a retry safe.

Officer corrections are never destroyed by a re-run: a candidate that has been
reviewed is left in place and the machine reading is refreshed only where the
officer has not yet decided.
