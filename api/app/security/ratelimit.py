"""Rate limiting.

A fixed-window counter in Redis, incremented atomically. Fixed windows are used
rather than a sliding log because the counters are cheap, the behaviour is easy to
explain in an error message, and burst tolerance at a window edge is acceptable for
the limits involved here.

Sensitive endpoints (sign-in, password reset, public complaint submission) fail
closed when Redis is unavailable: refusing the request is better than silently
dropping brute-force protection. Ordinary endpoints fail open so that a Redis
outage does not take the whole workspace down.

# not implemented: docs/KNOWN_LIMITS.md records that configuration for it exists and no code
# fetches a URL. The limit is here so the budget is decided before the feature is written.
#
# API_PER_SESSION is a general per-session ceiling that was never wired up. Measuring the
# deployment is what found it: scripts/measure_load.py drove 3,132 requests across four
# sessions and saw zero 429 responses. It is left unenforced rather than switched on, because
# the same measurement puts sustained read throughput at about 122 requests per second while
# this limit would cap a session at 10, so enabling it as written would throttle legitimate
# workspace use by an order of magnitude. It needs a number derived from measurement before
# it means anything. docs/THREAT_MODEL.md already states that rate limits protect specific
# endpoints and that there is no general protection, which remains accurate.
