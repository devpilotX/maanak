"""Permissions and jurisdiction scope.

Two independent gates, both enforced server-side:

Role permission
    What kind of action the account may perform at all.

Jurisdiction scope
    Which records the account may perform it on.

Both must pass. A reviewer holding ``inspection.decide`` still cannot decide an
inspection belonging to another jurisdiction, and the scope is applied inside the
SQL query rather than after loading, so a guessed UUID returns 404.

Jurisdiction codes are hierarchical, dash-separated, most general first::

    IN                  national
    IN-HR               state
    IN-HR-GURUGRAM      district

An account at ``IN-HR`` covers ``IN-HR`` and everything beneath it. It does not
cover ``IN`` or ``IN-PB``.
