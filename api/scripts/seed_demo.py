"""Prepare a workspace for demonstration or manual exploration.

Creates one account per role with known credentials, loads the starter rule set, and
takes every rule version through simulation and approval so the workspace is usable
immediately.

    docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e API_URL=http://api:8000 \
        --entrypoint python api scripts/seed_demo.py

Options through the environment:

    DEMO_PASSWORD     password for every account (default below)
    DEMO_EMAIL_DOMAIN domain for the account addresses (default example.org)
    SKIP_RULES=1      create accounts only

These are development credentials for a local workspace. They are printed to the
terminal on purpose, and a real deployment must not use them: there is no public
registration, and every account here is created through the ordinary authenticated
administration endpoint.
