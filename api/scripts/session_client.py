"""An HTTP client for the verification suites that renews an expired session.

Access tokens live 15 minutes. The browser application handles this in
``web/js/api.js``: on a 401 it calls the refresh endpoint once and retries the
original request. The verification suites did not, so a suite whose flow includes a
long OCR wait could burn most of the token lifetime and then fail on a later step
with ``session_expired``. The failure moved between steps from run to run, which is
what a clock-driven problem looks like.

Using this client fixes that and has a second benefit: the suites now exercise the
refresh-and-retry path that real sessions depend on, instead of only ever using a
freshly minted token.

``verify_auth_flow.py`` deliberately asserts on expiry and revocation semantics and
must keep using a plain client.
