"""Compare the API surface against the operations the browser application calls.

The question this answers is "can an officer actually reach this feature?". An endpoint
nobody calls is either a gap in the interface or dead weight in the API, and both are
worth knowing about before anyone demonstrates the product.

Paths are read out of the template literals in web/js, so `/inspections/${id}/checks`
matches the spec's `/api/v1/inspections/{inspection_id}/checks`.

    docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo maanak-api:latest \
      python api/scripts/check_api_reach.py --base http://localhost:8000

Without --base it reads the committed route table from the source instead, so it works
without a running stack.
