"""Build one worked example end to end, using the accounts ``seed_demo.py`` creates.

A freshly seeded workspace has accounts and rules but no work in it, so every count
on the overview reads zero and the detail screens have nothing to open. This walks a
single case through the whole path so that the workspace shows something real:

    consumer complaint -> triage -> inspection -> evidence -> OCR -> officer review
    -> checks -> decision -> report -> case -> notice served

Run it after ``seed_demo.py``:

    docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e API_URL=http://api:8000 \
        --entrypoint python api scripts/seed_example.py

Everything it creates is marked as sample data. The label image is generated, the
company and contact details are invented, and the addresses are on example.org.
Nothing here refers to a real product, premises, brand or person.
