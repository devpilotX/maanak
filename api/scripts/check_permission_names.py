"""Check that every permission the interface asks for actually exists.

`can('inspection.run_checks')` looks right and reads right, but the permission is
called `checks.run`. A name that does not exist is simply never held, so the control it
guards is hidden from everybody, including the roles that do hold the real permission.
Nothing fails loudly: the button is just absent.

This compares every string passed to `can(...)` and every `data-permission` attribute
against the Permission enum.
