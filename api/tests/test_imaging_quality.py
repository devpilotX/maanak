"""Unit tests for the image quality signals.

These exist because of one photograph. A 679x679 catalogue image of a nutrition panel,
shot against seamless white, was refused with three blocking failures: glare at 54.91 per
cent of the frame against a 3 per cent threshold, bright clipping at 70.8 against 25, and
resolution below the floor. Only the resolution finding was true. The other two were the
white backdrop being counted as a blown highlight, once as glare and again as clipping.

The fix has to hold in both directions, so both directions are asserted here: a backdrop
stops being reported, and a real highlight on the package keeps being reported.
