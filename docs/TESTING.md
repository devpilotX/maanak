# Testing

Every command below has been run. Each suite prints one line per check with the
measured value, so a passing run reads as a statement of what was verified rather than a
count.

## The commands

```bash
# 1. Formatting, lint and types
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint sh api scripts/quality.sh

# 2. Fast unit tests, the prose gate, then the live-stack suites. Mount the repository
#    root rather than api/ alone: the prose gate reads web/ and docs/, and the label
#    parity test reads web/js/util.js.
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo/api \
  -e PYTHONPATH=/repo/api --entrypoint sh api scripts/run_tests.sh

# Unit tests and the prose gate only, no services needed
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo/api \
  -e PYTHONPATH=/repo/api -e MAANAK_TEST_SCOPE=fast \
  --entrypoint sh api scripts/run_tests.sh

# 3. Browser and accessibility
docker build -f api/Dockerfile.browser -t maanak-browser:dev api
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 maanak-browser:dev
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 -e API_URL=http://api:8000 \
  maanak-browser:dev python scripts/audit_app.py
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 maanak-browser:dev python scripts/measure_a11y.py
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 maanak-browser:dev python scripts/scan_tints.py --app
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 maanak-browser:dev python scripts/check_links.py

# 4. Archive integrity
bash scripts/package.sh && bash scripts/verify_package.sh

# 5. The generated documents and the shared workspace chrome. Both need a seeded
#    workspace, so run these after scripts/seed_example.py rather than after a reset.
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e API_URL=http://api:8000 \
  --entrypoint python api scripts/check_report_text.py
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 maanak-browser:dev python scripts/check_workspace_chrome.py

# 6. The officer workflow, driven through the interface from an empty inspection to an
#    opened case. Needs the demo accounts and a generated label to upload.
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --user root -v "$PWD/api:/app" \
  --entrypoint python api scripts/make_sample_label.py
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD:/repo" -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w \
  -e BASE_URL=http://web:8080 maanak-browser:dev python scripts/verify_officer_flow.py

# 7. Static checks that need no stack. Each one exists because it caught a real defect.
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo maanak-api:latest \
  python api/scripts/check_js_bindings.py web/js
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -v "$PWD/api:/api" -w /repo maanak-api:latest \
  sh -c "PYTHONPATH=/api python api/scripts/check_permission_names.py"
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/api:/w" -w /w maanak-api:latest \
  python scripts/check_error_messages.py
docker run --rm --network maanak_default -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo maanak-api:latest \
  python api/scripts/check_api_reach.py --base http://api:8000
```

Two ordering rules matter, and ignoring either produces a confusing failure.

The eight `verify_*` suites and the integration half of `run_tests.sh` each bootstrap
their own workspace, so they reset the data as they go. Anything that needs the worked
example, which is `audit_app.py`, `check_report_text.py` and `check_workspace_chrome.py`,
has to run after `seed_demo.py` and `seed_example.py`, not before.

Sign-in is rate limited per address and per account and fails closed, so a long session
of repeated runs eventually gets `invalid_credentials` rather than a session. Clear the
counters without touching the data:

```bash
docker compose exec redis sh -c \
  "redis-cli --scan --pattern 'maanak:rl:*' | xargs -r -n1 redis-cli DEL"
```

Reset application data between runs when driving the suites directly:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps migrate python scripts/reset_data.py
```

It truncates every table, restarts the reference sequences and clears the Redis
rate-limit counters. The counters matter: sign-in is limited per address and fails
closed, so repeated runs from one container would otherwise start returning 429.

## What each suite proves

| Suite | Checks | Needs | Proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `verify_schema.py` | 14 | PostgreSQL | 30 tables, 184 indexes, 29 `CHECK` constraints, 74 foreign keys exist; `lower(email)` uniqueness is a functional index; `audit_events` rejects `UPDATE` and `DELETE` at the database level |
| `verify_security.py` | 51 | nothing | Argon2id hashing and salting; timing equalisation for unknown accounts; password policy; token signing, tampering rejection and key rotation; opaque refresh tokens stored only as hashes; the full permission matrix; hierarchical jurisdiction scope including prefix-confusion rejection |
| `verify_extraction.py` | 62 | nothing | Quantity parsing and exact unit conversion; Devanagari digits; multipiece totals; price parsing with Indian digit grouping; half-up rounding to paise; date precision and preserved ambiguity; declaration detection with image regions |
| `verify_rules.py` | 71 | nothing | Absent evidence never becomes a violation; unit-price arithmetic with recorded steps; character height refuses to guess from pixels; quantity band boundaries; effective-date windows; exceptions; only approved versions apply; the simulator gates approval |
| `verify_auth_flow.py` | 70 | API | Bootstrap is one-time; identical errors for unknown account and wrong password; `HttpOnly` cookies with a path-restricted refresh cookie; CSRF enforcement; refresh rotation; reuse of a rotated token revokes the family; immediate session revocation; mass-assignment rejection; the second factor against the RFC 6238 vectors |
| `verify_pipeline.py` | 56 | API, worker, storage | A blurred, glared image is refused with specific instructions; SHA-256 matches the uploaded bytes; duplicates and non-images are refused; the worker reports real progress; candidates carry image regions inside the original bounds; raw OCR is retained; the stored file still matches its hash; the downloaded original is byte-identical |
| `verify_workflow.py` | 117 | full stack | Rule seeding as drafts; approval refused before simulation; the author cannot self-approve; checks before review produce no violations; a correction preserves the machine reading; stale writes are refused; every finding cites an approved rule version; an inspector cannot decide; cross-jurisdiction access returns 404; report snapshot, PDF and DOCX hashes; public verification leaks nothing |
| `verify_matters.py` | 86 | full stack | A public complaint with no account; the published triage priority; status lookup needs reference *and* contact; conversion to an inspection carrying the consumer's photograph; the controller hierarchy; case opening requires an issued report; a served notice is frozen; the audit chain verifies, and a forged event is detected with its sequence named |
| `verify_browser.py` | 60 | full stack + Chromium | Zero serious or critical axe violations on eight pages; one `h1` per page; the skip link is the first tab stop; every complaint field is labelled; no horizontal overflow at 320px or 390px; sign-in through the interface; `maanak_access` is `HttpOnly` and `maanak_csrf` is not; registers render real data; an inspector sees a permission message; sign-out and the unauthenticated redirect work |
| `tests/test_extraction_values.py` | 42 | nothing | The arithmetic a finding rests on, asserted as exact `Decimal` values |
| `tests/test_domain_units.py` | 49 | nothing | GS1 check digits worked through by hand; permission matrix; jurisdiction isolation; state machine edges, guards and reachability; canonical hashing determinism |
| `tests/test_presentation.py` | 166 | nothing | Every enum label reads as English rather than as a raw value; the JavaScript override table matches the Python one; counted nouns never fall back to "(s)"; the decision choices offered are exactly the ones the service accepts; no em dash survives in any source file; brand and product name compose without repeating the brand, in the API and in the browser; every one of the permissions has a phrase an officer can read, so no denial names a dotted identifier |
| `tests/test_imaging_quality.py` | 23 | nothing | A plain studio backdrop is not counted as glare and not counted again as bright clipping, and a genuine highlight burnt into the panel still blocks. Both directions, because a fix that silenced glare everywhere would be worse than the false positive it replaced. Also the confusable-glyph detector: it flags "lodised" and stays quiet on "Lemon Pickle" |
| `tests/test_totp.py` | 29 | nothing | The second factor against the RFC 6238 published vectors, the replay window, and the drift tolerance |
| `tests/test_ocr_profiles.py` | 9 | nothing | The reader's profile escalation picks by measured score, and stops once a profile reads well enough |
| `tests/test_verification_suites.py` | 3 unit, 5 live-stack, 1 browser | varies | Wraps the suites above so a failure prints the suite's own output, and asserts a minimum count per suite so one cannot silently shrink |
| `measure_ocr_accuracy.py` | 80 fields | full stack | Ten declarations with known correct values, scored against the extraction output under eight conditions: as generated, scaled to 1200 and 900 wide, rotated 2 and 6 degrees, JPEG quality 55, blurred, and on a white backdrop. 72 of 80 correct. The figure is for generated labels and is not an accuracy figure for photographs |
| `measure_ocr_real.py` | 14 photographs | full stack + network | Photographs of real Indian packs contributed to Open Food Facts, scored against each product's declared quantity. 6 of 14 yielded at least one declaration, 10 declarations in total, and net quantity was read from none of them. The quality gate refused 5 outright. The result that matters is that **no photograph produced a non-compliant finding before review**. Not a labelled benchmark, and 14 is too few to quote a percentage from |
| `check_prose.py` | 43 files | nothing | No machine-writing tells across 28 pages and 15 documents, 34,532 words: no tool leak markers, no scaffold headings, no participial tails, no copula avoidance, no em dash anywhere |
| `audit_app.py` | 140 | full stack + Chromium | Every route in the OpenAPI document is declared; all 28 pages load and reach their data; no stringified object or undefined value reaches the screen; the inspection screen passes axe as a reviewer, with the decision form rendered |
| `measure_a11y.py` | 14 pages | Chromium | Zero axe violations at WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 level A and AA; zero targets under 24 by 24 CSS pixels, which axe has no rule for; zero sticky or fixed positioning on a public page |
| `scan_tints.py --app` | 24 pages | Chromium | No warm-tinted surface at any of three breakpoints, across the public site and the workspace |
| `check_links.py` | 0 broken | Chromium | Every internal link resolves and every in-page anchor has an element to land on |
| `check_workspace_chrome.py` | 14 screens | full stack + Chromium | One header and one footer on every workspace screen, the standing note present in each, and no em dash in the rendered text |
| `check_report_text.py` | 2 documents | full stack | The generated PDF and DOCX contain no em dash, no "(s)" plural, no stringified object and no raw enum value, checked by extracting the text a reader receives |
| `verify_officer_flow.py` | 44 | full stack + Chromium | The whole officer workflow driven through the interface: open an inspection, have a glared photograph refused with a named reason, upload a readable one, wait for the worker, read the OCR output, confirm eleven readings, run the checks, send for reviewer decision, record the decision, issue the report, open the case |
| `check_js_bindings.py` | 27 modules | nothing | No module uses a helper it never imported. A missing import throws only when the line runs, so one referenced in a rarely-taken branch can sit broken indefinitely |
| `check_permission_names.py` | 33 names | nothing | Every permission the interface asks for exists. A name that does not exist is never held, so the control it guards is hidden from everyone with no error anywhere |
| `check_error_messages.py` | 177 messages | nothing | No error an officer reads names a JSON key or a database column |
| `check_api_reach.py` | 98 operations | API | Every endpoint is either reached from a screen or recorded, with a reason, as deliberately not reached |
| `check_demo_logins.py` | 7 accounts | full stack | Every account the README publishes actually signs in, so a walkthrough does not begin with a failed sign-in |
| `verify_restore.py` | 11 | a restored deployment | The audit chain recomputes and its head sequence, head hash and event count all match what the backup recorded; `audit_events` still refuses `UPDATE`; every evidence object and every other stored object matches the hash recorded at upload; every report snapshot recomputes |
| `measure_load.py` | a capacity baseline | full stack | Ramps read concurrency and drains a queue of OCR jobs, and counts every 429 rather than hiding it. Figures for one host, not a benchmark |

Total: **527 assertions** across the eight verification suites, plus **321 pytest items**
in the fast set and **5** more that need the live stack. Every figure in this table was
read off a run on the current tree, not carried forward.

## Running one suite

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e API_URL=http://api:8000 \
  --entrypoint python api scripts/verify_workflow.py
```

## Interpreting a failure

Each suite prints `ok` or `FAIL` per check with the measured value, then a summary. A
failure names the check and shows what was measured against what was expected, for
example:

```
  FAIL  exactly at the threshold with ±0.2 mm is undetermined, not decided
```

The pytest wrapper (`tests/test_verification_suites.py`) reproduces the suite's own
output on failure rather than an opaque assertion error, and asserts a minimum number of
checks per suite so a suite cannot silently shrink.

## What CI runs

`.github/workflows/verify.yml`, with every job required:

| Job | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `quality` | `ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, `mypy app` |
| `unit` | Fast tests with coverage, uploaded as an artefact |
| `static-checks` | The prose gate, `check_js_bindings.py`, `check_permission_names.py`, `check_error_messages.py` |
| `migrations` | Upgrade to head, downgrade, upgrade again, then **fail on model drift** if an autogenerate produces any table or column change |
| `integration` | Full stack, the live-stack suites, the browser suite, then a seeded workspace and `audit_app.py`, `verify_officer_flow.py`, `check_api_reach.py`, `check_report_text.py`, `measure_a11y.py`, `scan_tints.py` and `check_links.py` |
| `supply-chain` | `pip-audit --strict`, CycloneDX SBOM, gitleaks secret scan, Trivy container scan failing on HIGH or CRITICAL |
| `release-archive` | Builds the archive and verifies it extracts complete |

Nothing is marked `continue-on-error`.

Until this was written, CI ran ten of the checks listed on this page and the other twelve
only ever ran by hand. That is how `check_js_bindings.py` came to be documented as
covering 26 modules when the tree held 27: nothing re-measured it. Two of the checks would
also report success while reading nothing at all, because they resolved `web/` and `app/`
relative to the working directory, so running one from the wrong folder scanned an empty
set and exited zero. Each now resolves its own paths and fails on an empty scan.

The two OCR benchmarks are deliberately not in CI. `measure_ocr_accuracy.py` takes several
minutes of worker time per condition, and `measure_ocr_real.py` downloads photographs from
Open Food Facts, so it needs outbound network access and its corpus changes as people
contribute. Both are run by hand and their results recorded in
[KNOWN_LIMITS.md](KNOWN_LIMITS.md).

## Not tested

Stated plainly, with the reasoning in `docs/KNOWN_LIMITS.md`:

- **OCR accuracy.** No labelled corpus of real package photographs was available, so no
  character or word error rate is claimed. The pipeline is proven to work; its field
  accuracy is unmeasured.
- **Performance under load.** `measure_load.py` gives a capacity baseline for one host,
  but there is no response-time budget, no sustained soak test and no storage-growth
  projection.
- **Manual screen-reader testing.** axe-core covers what a tool can; it does not cover
  what a NVDA or VoiceOver user experiences.
- **Every route swept for object-level authorisation.** Jurisdiction isolation is proven
  on inspections, complaints, cases, reports and the audit trail; it was not
  independently probed on all 98 operations.
